# Deforestation
A project is always used to mark the end of each data analysis class. This project on deforestation marks the end of SQL classes in the Data Analysis 3rd Cohort with Victor Somadina.
# Introduction
This project presented opportunities to further use and understand some advanced SQL functions such as the windows functions, common table expressions(CTEs), Joins, Subquerys etc. Three datasets were used to carry out this project, namely Forest Area, Land Area and Regions. All three datasets had some similar columns, these are Country_Name, and Country_Code. 
# Sample Datasets
The image below a return of all the three datasets used in carrying out this project.
